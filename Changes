Revision history for Progress-Any-Output

0.04    2014-10-14 (PERLANCAR)

        - Allow passing reference (object).

        - Return the instantiated object.


0.03    2013-05-18 (SHARYANTO)

        - Update to Progress::Any 0.08.

        - By default set output for task='' instead of task='main', to be able
          to capture all indicators' progress.


0.02    2013-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Should not create any progress indicator because it might initialize
          target & pos and renders further initialization (in user's modules) as
          no-op.


0.01    2013-05-16 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release.
